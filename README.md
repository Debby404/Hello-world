# Hello-world
This is my first input for  Github. I'm learning how to use the platform to allow better documentation for future projects.

### A bit about myself
I'm Debby, and I'm new to the world of front end development. I received a scholarschip from Google to participate in a challegen called grow with google challenge and have studied some basic web dev with Udacity for the last 4 month. Since then I received a second full scholarship for the Front end developers Nanodegree taught by Udacity and I'm learning more every day. My goal is to become a great web developer and be part of something greater.
